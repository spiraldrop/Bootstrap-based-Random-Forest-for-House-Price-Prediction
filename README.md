# Bootstrap-based-Random-Forest-for-House-Price-Prediction

This README provides an overview of the tasks accomplished in the project, focusing on the analysis of code from a Jupyter Notebook. The project is divided into three main tasks: Task 1, Task 2, and Task 3. Below, you will find a concise summary of each task.

## Task 1 - Creating Samples
In this task, we generated 30 samples from the Boston dataset. Each sample consisted of 303 data points randomly chosen from the entire dataset. Additionally, 203 data points were replicated from the sampled data. Importantly, every sample had a different set of columns, ensuring that they were not identical.

## Task 2 - Building High Variance Models and Calculating MSE and OOB Score
In Task 2, we built regression trees on each of the 30 samples created in Task 1. For each sample, we computed the predicted values of all 506 data points in the dataset. We used these predictions to calculate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for each sample. We also calculated the Out-of-Bag (OOB) score as a measure of model performance.

We repeated Task 1 and Task 2 for 35 iterations to gather a range of MSE and OOB scores. We then computed the confidence intervals for both MSE and OOB scores using the Central Limit Theorem. The 95% confidence intervals were found to be (0.0602, 0.1025) for MSE and (14.3189, 15.6349) for OOB Score.

## Task 3 - Predicting House Price for a Query Point
In Task 3, we predicted the house price for a single query point. We utilized the 30 models created in Task 2 and performed regression on the output generated by these models. The final predicted price for the query point was found to be 18.5.

In summary, this project involved creating samples, building high variance models, and calculating MSE and OOB scores. It demonstrated the application of bootstrapping techniques and random forest modeling for predicting house prices.
